Here are a few tips to get you started:

2. Select "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom.
4. Double-click the "Path" entry under "System variables".
5. With the "New" button in the PATH editor, add C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ and C:\Program  Files\Git\cmd\ to the end of the list.
6. Close and re-open your console.


**Modifying PATH on Windows 7:**

1. Right-click "Computer" on the Desktop or Start Menu.
2. Select "Properties".
3. On the very far left, click the "Advanced system settings" link.
4. Click the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom.
5. Double-click the "Path" entry under "System variables".
6. At the end of "Variable value", insert a ; if there is not already one, and then C:\Program Files\Git\bin\;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\. Do not put a space between ; and the entry.
7. Close and re-open your console.

Go read the **README.md** and install React (do not make a new app)

Cloning an Existing Repository: **The Basement Website**

(https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

* Read "Cloning an Existing Repository"

### To run your local file

* npm run

# How to make a commit in Github

* run "git status": recommended to run before git add

* run "git add [file]"

> **Note**: When adding to your commit, you need to add the file you are working on.

* git commit -m "descriptive commit message": This starts the commit process, and allows you to include the commit message at the same time.

### Updating Commits With Git Commit Amend

While "git commit --amend" does change history, it only changes the most recent commit on your current branch. This can be an extremely useful command for commits that:

* Haven't been pushed to the remote yet
* Have a spelling error in the commit message
* Don't contain the changes that you'd like to contain
